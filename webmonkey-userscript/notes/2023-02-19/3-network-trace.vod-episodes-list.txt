--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

observations:
=============
  * disappointing..
    - pages for an individual episode contain a longer list of available episodes
      than pages having the singular purpose to list available episodes
  * example:
    - individual episode:
        https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/feb-19-sec-antony-blinken-and-fmr-gov-larry-hogan-163646533562
      lists:
        20 available episodes (w/ a complete dataset, including video URLs)
    - list of episodes:
        https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes
      lists:
        09 available episodes (w/ a complete dataset, including video URLs)

considerations:
===============
  * when processing pages having the singular purpose to list available episodes,
    I'm tempted to:
    - cherry pick the URL for the first available episode
    - download HTML w/ XHR
    - use regex to extract content of <script> tag
    - parse JSON
    - process JSON to obtain a list of available episodes
    - compare lengths of the two lists (current page vs. XHR) and use whichever is longer
  * better yet, a simpler option is to:
    - always redirect to the URL for the first available episode
    - always show a list of all available episodes on pages intended to view a particular episode,
      which makes all pages for all episodes in a particular series render identically..
    - to distinguish the episode currently loaded,
      the corresponding list item could be identified, and a css class added to it
